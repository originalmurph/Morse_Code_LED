This is a simple program that takes user input from the keyboard and converts
it to Morse Code via an LED attached to an Arduino board.

Future goals for this project:
1. Convert Morse Code from light to text
2. Create sounds for the Morse Code
3. Convert Morse Code from sound to text (and/or light)
4. Allow a user to "tap" in the Morse Code using a small button

Modifications by Joe Murphy 11/2018
1)Fixed a malloc leak.  The linked list is built per character (not sure why not pulled directly from string as yet), but the very tight memory supply runs out very fast as is.
      Also fixed 1st link (root) not being used for a character.
2)Put large table (Ardunio wise) into code space, which frees up quite a bit of data RAM
